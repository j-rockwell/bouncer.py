# Bouncer
**Problem:**
A while back when I was running one of my projects we had a community Discord server that was constantly under attack by bot accounts who would join the server and automatically message an advertisement to every person on our member list.

**Solution:**
Bouncer is a simply written Discord bot which will notify new users to type **!verify** in a specified channel and it will automatically assign them a "Verification" role.

**NOTE:** The Discord server must be configured to not display all members by default, Bouncer.py does **not** do this for you.
